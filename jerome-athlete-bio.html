    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6QvfvScS/Screen-Shot-Tool-20250715123859.png" alt="Jerome Cunningham Bio" class="bio-img">
    <p>Iâ€™m Jerome Cunningham, a former NFL tight end with experience playing for the New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, Detroit Lions, and Washington Football Team. Iâ€™ve lived a life dedicated to performance, growth, and excellenceâ€”both on the field and now in the world of technology.</p>
    <p>My journey is built on discipline, adaptability, and perseverance. As a player, I embraced the grind, studied complex playbooks, and led by example. These same values now fuel my transition into software engineering and cybersecurity, where I continue to challenge myself and evolve.</p>

  <section class="section" id="career">
    <h2>NFL Career Highlights</h2>
    <p>â€¢ Played in the NFL from 2014 to 2020 across four teams, competing at the highest level of professional football.</p>
    <p>â€¢ Contributed to offensive systems with advanced blocking, route running, and play recognition under pressure.</p>
    <p>â€¢ Represented the teams in community outreach initiatives, youth mentorship, and public speaking engagements that inspired future athletes.</p>
    <p>â€¢ Developed leadership and resilience, learning to perform under immense pressure in front of millions of viewers while maintaining a consistent training regimen year-round.</p>
    <p>â€¢ Acquired a deep understanding of teamwork, preparation, and mindsetâ€”skills now transferred into the world of technology and problem-solving.</p>

  <section class="section" id="transition">
    <h2>Transition to Tech</h2>
    <p>My path from athlete to engineer is a story of transformation. After retiring from the NFL, I dedicated myself to the tech industryâ€”pursuing certifications in full-stack web development, data structures, relational databases, and cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>Through programs like Metaâ€™s Full Stack Developer Certification and Googleâ€™s Cybersecurity Certificate, Iâ€™ve built applications, REST APIs, and secure web systems that reflect my attention to detail and drive to perform at elite levels. Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems, just like studying defenses and adapting on the fly as an athlete.</p>
    <p>Now, I bring the same work ethic and playbook-driven mindset to software engineeringâ€”continuously building, learning, and executing with precision.</p>
